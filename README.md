**UrbanTempo**
==============

This directory contains the UrbanTempo package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language and software environment for statistical computing.
This package contains computer code to **plot urban temporalities from observational data**, similarly to figure 4.6 in Marie Gibert's [PhD thesis](https://www.academia.edu/7549254) (2014).
As such, this package can be **of interest to urban geographers and anthropologists**.

The development of this package is funded by the [Universit√© Paris-Diderot](https://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), the copyright hence is owned by this university.
However, the code is available under a [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) license, the [GNU Affero General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) (version 3 and later).
See the COPYING file for details.

The content of this package is versioned using the [git](http://www.git-scm.com/) software, the central repository being hosted on the [GitHub](https://github.com/marieflutre/UrbanTempo) website.


# Installation

You, the user, first need to install on your computer the R software (details [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/)), available under a free software license, for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.

Once this is done, it is recommended to also install the RStudio software (the Desktop version; details [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop)), also available under a free software license, for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.
For Mac users, if asked, there is no need to install "git" or "XCode" tools.

Once this is done, launch RStudio, which will also automatically launch an interactive R session.
At this stage, you still need to install the devtools package, along with its dependencies.
This is easily done via the following command, to be copy-pasted and executed in the R console of RStudio:
```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once this is done, you need to load the devtools package into the session, and install the UrbanTempo package from GitHub, via the following commands, to be copy-pasted and executed in the R console:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("marieflutre/UrbanTempo", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

Once this is done, the UrbanTempo package should be available on your computer.


# Usage

Once the Urban Tempo package is available on your computer, it can be loaded into a R session:
```
library(UrbanTempo)
```

You are encouraged to first read the introductory tutorial in details:
```
browseVignettes("UrbanTempo")
```

This should automatically display the R vignette coming with the package into your default web browser, such as Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer.

Some information about the package is also available directly via the R console:
```
help(package="UrbanTempo")
```

For any given function, its documentation is available by adding the question mark symbol, `?`, in front of it, for instance:
```
?readTemporalities
```

If you are new to R, it is advised to read the official [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).
